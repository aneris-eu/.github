# The Project

The ANERIS project aims to tackle the rapid loss of ocean biodiversity by developing innovative tools and technology for monitoring, research and management of marine life, and introducing the concept of Operational Marine Biology (OMB). OMB is a biodiversity information system which allows long-term routine measurements of ocean and coastal ecosystems and their quick interpretation and dissemination to all relevant stakeholders.
